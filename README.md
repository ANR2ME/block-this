#Summary
**Block This** is a DNS/VPN based ad blocking & privacy app for Android, that blocks malicious or unwanted internet content by filtering DNS requests and redirecting them to `127.0.0.1 (localhost)`. It uses a dummy VPN client in order to go around the restrictions in Android and change the DNS settings without having root access. The backend behind the app is a DNS based on [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) - an open source DNS management software working with [MySQL](https://mysql.com) as a datasource.

#About

I created the app for my own convenience as I needed a privacy and ad blocking solution for my Android device, which I did not want to root. The app worked so well for me that I decided to put it on the Play Store. It had a huge success with almost 1 million downloads in just 2 months, but then it was taken down by Google. It is now hosted on my website as an APK. I open source it with the hope to get further developed and supported by the community.
